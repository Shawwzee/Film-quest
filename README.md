# Film-quest

A web app where you can find out information about a film/tv series, this app uses the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API for search queries and Font Awesome for the icons. The user can find out information such as release date, actors and what critics scores it got and view the movie's poster. 

The UI is somewhat responsive but could use some work, this is my first time using media queries to control the layout of information and this is an area that I will continue to work on.
